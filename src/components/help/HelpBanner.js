                  We provide holistic support with professional training and
                  practical advice to equip those recovering from gambling
                  addiction with the right tools to positively restart their
                  lives. We give them a better chance of not relapsing by
                  providing reassurance and respect, support and encouragement
                  from mentors who know what itâ€™s like to suffer the devastating
                  effects of gambling addiction and how hard it is to maintain
                  recovery after treatment.
